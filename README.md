# Expense Manager

## Project Description
This project was created as part of the technical test for the Onfly company. The project focuses on expense management, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete expenses via API. Additionally, the project provides the ability to create and retrieve expenses locally when the device is offline or the API is unavailable. Local expenses are synchronized with the web when the device regains internet connectivity.
